📊 CORD-19 Data Exploration Project
📌 Project Overview

This project explores the CORD-19 dataset, focusing on metadata analysis of COVID-19 research papers.
The workflow includes:

Data loading and cleaning

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualizations (publications trend, top journals, word clouds)

An interactive Streamlit dashboard for exploration


🛠️ Steps Performed
1. Data Loading

Loaded metadata.csv into a Pandas DataFrame.

Checked dataset shape, columns, and missing values.

2. Data Cleaning

Dropped high-missing-value columns (mag_id, arxiv_id, etc.).

Removed rows without abstracts or publish dates.

Converted publish_time to datetime format and extracted year.

Added abstract_word_count column.

Saved the cleaned dataset as cord19_cleaned.csv.

3. Exploratory Analysis

Publications per year: number of papers by publication year.

Top journals: most frequent publishing journals.

Word cloud: frequent keywords from paper titles.

Distribution by source: where papers originated from.

4. Visualization

Bar plots, line charts, and word clouds generated using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and WordCloud.

5. Streamlit App

Sidebar filters: select year range and journal.

Interactive plots and data preview.

Dynamic updates based on selected filters.


📈 Example Visualizations

Publications over time (line chart)

Top journals (bar chart)

Word cloud of titles

Distribution by source (bar chart)


🚀 How to Run
Prerequisites

Python 3.9+

Install dependencies:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn wordcloud streamlit

Run Streamlit App
streamlit run app.py


📑 Reflection

Challenges: Handling missing values and large dataset size. The year slider in Streamlit sometimes froze when dataset was large, so subsetting data helped.

Learning Outcomes:

Gained experience with Pandas for data cleaning.

Learned to generate visualizations for real-world datasets.

Built and deployed an interactive Streamlit app.

Next Steps: Could add NLP-based keyword extraction, citation analysis, or trend prediction.
